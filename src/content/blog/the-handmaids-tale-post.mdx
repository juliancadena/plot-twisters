## Book

The Handmaid's Tale is a novel by Margaret Atwood, published in 1985. It’s
one of her most famous books, known for its strong social critique and focus
on feminist ideas. The story is a mix of dystopian fiction and science fiction, set
in a future society. Even though it was written in the 1980s, it feels strangely
relevant today, almost like a warning.

The story takes place in the Republic of Gilead, a strict society that takes over
after a violent uprising in the United States. Due to pollution and other
problems, birth rates have dropped, and Gilead’s leaders use harsh religious
rules to control society, especially women. Women lose all their rights and are
divided into groups, with “Handmaids” forced to have children for powerful
men. This unsettling society is one that nobody would want to live in, and it
has struck a chord with readers for years, even becoming a bestseller again
recently. It makes you wonder—why does this dark world feel so familiar?

The main character, Offred (her real name is June), is one of these
Handmaids, valued only for her ability to have children. She lives in the house
of Commander Fred Waterford and his wife, Serena Joy, who both play big
roles in enforcing Gilead’s strict rules. Offred tries to quietly rebel, longing for
the family she lost and making small, secret connections with others, like her
fellow Handmaid's Moira and Ofglen, and Nick, a servant in the house who
becomes her lover. Through Offred’s story, we see both the fear she lives in
and the little acts of defiance that keep her going.

Although The Handmaid's Tale has been made into movies before, the 2017
TV series really brought the book back into the spotlight, even causing it to
sell out in stores.

The Handmaid's Tale stirs up mixed emotions. The terrifying world it describes
makes us think about the cruelty people are capable of, how easily
democratic systems can fall, and how we often repeat the same mistakes. At
the same time, it reminds us why stories like this are so important. As the
saying goes, “culture sets us free,” and this book doesn’t just inform us—it also
warns us by showing a world we would never want.

With themes of power, control, and human resilience, Atwood’s novel stays
relevant no matter how much time passes. It’s a dystopian story that feels
surprisingly close to the world we live in now.

Following a terrorist attack that results in the death of the U.S. President and
most members of Congress, a group called the "Sons of Jacob" takes control
and launches a revolution. They scrap the Constitution under the pretext of
"restoring order" and establish a new regime known as the Republic of
Gilead. This authoritarian society, struggling with a severely low birth rate, is
built on a distorted form of religious fundamentalism that treats women as the
property of the state.

Amidst this turmoil is Offred, whose real name is June. She is one of the few
remaining fertile women in Gilead and is forced to serve as a concubine for
the Commanders, like many others who are pushed into sexual servitude as
part of a desperate effort to boost the population. Suddenly, she finds herself
alone, cut off from her family, and realizing that all her rights have vanished
almost overnight.

Before Gilead's rise, she was a woman who fought for her rights, but now she
must survive in a world where even a small slip-up, a careless word, or a
wrong move could get her killed, as anyone could be an informer. Despite
these dangers, Offred is determined to endure. Her primary mission is to stay
alive and find the daughter who was taken from her. A desperate act
involving her daughter, Nicole, leads to unexpected consequences, making
Offred more committed to resisting than ever, while the Waterford household
falls apart.

The 2017 television adaptation features Elisabeth Moss as Offred, with Joseph
Fiennes playing the Commander and Yvonne Strahovski as Serena Joy, his
wife. The cast also includes Samira Wiley, Max Minghella, and O.T. Fagbenle,
among others.

This series, produced by MGM Television, is inspired by Margaret Atwood's
novel. It was brought to life by Bruce Miller, who served as creator, writer, and
producer, with Warren Littlefield, Daniel Wilson, Fran Sears, and Ilene Chaiken
as executive producers. The first three episodes were directed by Reed
Morano, setting the stage with a dark and intense tone.

I think that these powerful narratives put personal faces on complex issues
and provide a window into the human condition. I believe the intention of
the series is to elicit empathy from the viewer by presenting original voices on
universal subjects and inviting the audience to walk in someone else’s shoes.

## Comparison of styles

Literature varies significantly across countries, reflecting the unique histories,
cultures, and traditions of each region. Every nation’s literary landscape is
shaped by its language, social values, and historical context, resulting in
distinct genres and themes that resonate differently with readers worldwide.
At the same time, each author brings their own style and perspective to their
work, creating stories that attract specific audiences while contributing to the
diversity of global literature.

Some authors captivate readers with narratives deeply rooted in their cultural
heritage, blending local myths and traditions with universal themes. Others
adopt more universal tones, addressing global issues or experimenting with
styles that transcend borders. This diversity allows literature to act as both a
mirror of specific societies and a bridge to connect readers from different
backgrounds.

Ultimately, the variety in literary expression ensures that every reader can find
stories that resonate with them, whether they are drawn to introspective
tales, imaginative worlds, or sharp critiques of society. The unique voice ofeach author and the cultural influences behind their work create an endless
array of perspectives, enriching the global literary experience.

"The Creature in the Mirror" by Cecilia Eudave, Mexican literature, and "The
Handmaid's Tale" by Margaret Atwood share similarities despite their
differences in themes and styles. Eudave’s novel, steeped in fantasy and
introspection, invites readers to explore personal identity and inner fears
through a symbolic journey, reflecting a hallmark of Mexican literature—its
connection to mythology and cultural depth. In contrast, Atwood’s dystopian
narrative critiques societal oppression and gender inequality, presenting a
stark and plausible world built on systemic control.

Both works use symbolism effectively, though in different ways. Eudave’s
mirror represents self-discovery and personal growth, fitting seamlessly within
Mexican literature’s poetic and mystical traditions. Atwood employs stark,
societal symbols like the Handmaids’ clothing to expose power dynamics and
oppression, aligning with her precise and chilling prose. While Eudave’s
writing evokes reflection and emotional connection, Atwood’s sharp style
confronts readers with urgent political and social realities.

I think both novels demonstrate the power of literature to explore the human
condition from different angles. "The Creature in the Mirror" offers a rich,
cultural, and imaginative narrative that celebrates introspection and
creativity, while "The Handmaid’s Tale" delivers a thought-provoking critique
of societal systems. Together, they highlight the complementary nature of
storytelling—one fostering personal transformation, and the other driving
awareness and action. Both are essential reads for their unique approaches
to universal themes.
